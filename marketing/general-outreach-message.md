‚Ä¢ AI-powered collision prediction and anomaly detection
‚Ä¢ Integration with major telescopes (Vera Rubin, James Webb)
‚Ä¢ Voice command system and gamification elements
‚Ä¢ Multi-source data aggregation (NASA, ESA, Space-Track)
‚Ä¢ Advanced 3D visualization and interactive maps
‚Ä¢ Predictive analytics for space weather and cosmic events

**Technical Stack:**
‚Ä¢ Frontend: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
‚Ä¢ Backend: Node.js, multiple REST APIs integration
‚Ä¢ AI/ML: Predictive algorithms, pattern recognition
‚Ä¢ Visualization: Three.js, MapLibre, real-time data streaming
‚Ä¢ PWA: Progressive Web App with offline capabilities

**GitHub Repository:** [YOUR_GITHUB_LINK]
**Live Demo:** [YOUR_DEMO_LINK]

This project showcases my ability to:
- Build complex, scalable applications with modern technologies
- Integrate multiple data sources and APIs
- Implement AI/ML solutions for real-world problems
- Create intuitive user interfaces for complex data visualization
- Develop enterprise-grade applications with security and performance in mind

I'm passionate about space technology, AI, and creating solutions that advance our understanding of the universe. I'm actively seeking opportunities to contribute to innovative projects in space technology, AI development, or data science.

I would love to discuss potential collaborations, employment opportunities, or simply share insights about this project. Your feedback and expertise would be invaluable.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
